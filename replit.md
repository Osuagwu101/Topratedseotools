# SubsHub

A subscription services storefront where users can browse and purchase monthly access to popular productivity and AI tools. Payments are processed via Paystack.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 5000)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string
- Required env: `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` — Paystack secret key (falls back to `PAYSTACK_API_KEY` if unset)

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)
- Payments: Paystack

## Where things live

- `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` — single source of truth for all API contracts
- `lib/db/src/schema/` — Drizzle table definitions (products, orders)
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/` — Express route handlers
- `artifacts/store/src/pages/` — React pages (home, product, checkout, success)
- `artifacts/store/src/components/` — Shared UI components

## Architecture decisions

- Paystack payment flow: create order → initialize payment (server builds checkout with DB-sourced amount/email) → redirect to Paystack checkout → customer returns to `/success?reference=...` → verify on return
- The Paystack **webhook** (`POST /api/paystack/webhook`) is the source of truth for activation — it verifies the signature (HMAC SHA512 of the raw body), re-verifies the transaction server-side, then calls the shared `activateOrderByReference` helper. The client-triggered `/paystack/verify/:reference` route calls the same helper, so both paths produce identical, idempotent results (safe against Paystack's webhook retries and user double-visits)
- Verify/webhook re-check the amount actually paid against the order's `amountKobo`; underpayment marks the order `failed`/`underpaid` instead of `success`
- `tool_entitlements` table (not `orders.status` alone) is the access-control source: one row per activated order with `status` + `expiresAt`. Dashboard and the auto-login proxy both check `expiresAt > now()`, so expired subscriptions lose access automatically without a cron job
- Orders have a `durationMonths` (1/3/12) captured at creation; entitlement `expiresAt` is computed as `now() + durationMonths` at activation time
- Prices stored in kobo (1 NGN = 100 kobo) throughout, matching Paystack's API (which also expects/returns amounts in kobo) — no unit conversion needed for Paystack, unlike the brief Monnify migration
- `billingPeriod` is either "monthly" or "per_check" (Turnitin)
- Orders get a unique `reference` (SUB-XXXX, DB-unique) at creation time, used as Paystack's `reference` for matching
- Logged-in checkout skips the name/email form entirely — customer name/email are sourced from the Clerk profile, since there is no guest-checkout path
- `tool_servers` table supports multiple independent credential sets ("servers") per product (replacing the old one-credential-per-product model). Each `tool_entitlements` row stores the specific `serverId` it was granted against, so different subscribers on the same tool can be spread across different backing accounts. Proxy/autologin resolve access via `resolveServerForUser` (in `lib/toolAccess.ts`), which prefers the entitlement's assigned server and falls back to the product's first auto-login server for legacy rows with no `serverId`
- Admin panel (`/admin`, HTTP Basic auth via `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`) supports: per-product tiered pricing edits, full CRUD on `tool_servers`, Clerk user search/creation (`clerkClient.users`), manual entitlement grants (`POST /api/admin/grant`) that bypass Paystack by creating a `MANUAL-XXXX` order with `amountKobo: 0` and reusing `activateOrderByReference`, and a device sessions view enriched with Clerk email, parsed browser/OS/device type (from `lib/userAgent.ts`, dependency-free UA parsing), IP, and relative "last active"/absolute login timestamps
- User dashboard transaction history is grouped into collapsed-by-default accordion sections — Successful (`status==="success"`), Pending (`status==="pending"`), Failed (everything else, including the server-computed `"expired"` status for lapsed entitlements) — each with a count badge

## Product

All 11 subscription products are pre-seeded with tiered pricing (1/3/12 months, `priceKobo`/`price3MonthKobo`/`price12MonthKobo` — the latter two are nullable and checkout only shows durations that have a configured price):
- Grammarly (₦2,500/mo), Quillbot (₦2,500/mo), Phrasly (₦8,500/mo)
- ChatGPT (₦8,500/mo), StealthWriter (₦17,000/mo), NordVPN (₦18,000/mo)
- SEMrush (₦3,000/mo), CapCut (₦5,000/mo), Turnitin (₦2,300/check, 1-month pricing only)
- WriteHuman (₦8,500/mo), Jenni AI (₦7,500/mo)

## User preferences

_Populate as you build — explicit user instructions worth remembering across sessions._

## Gotchas

- Google Fonts `@import url(...)` must be the FIRST line in `index.css` before all other `@import` statements or PostCSS will error silently
- `react-icons/si` v5 does not export `SiOpenai` or `SiCapcut` — use `lucide-react` fallbacks instead
- Project briefly migrated to Monnify (sandbox keys) then reverted to Paystack per user request when live Monnify keys weren't available — Monnify route/schema history is in git if needed again
